**** Predicting House Prices with CRISP-DM: From Raw Data to Insights****

📌 Project Overview

This project applies the CRISP-DM (Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology to the House Prices dataset from Kaggle. The aim is to build models that accurately predict housing prices based on property features.

The workflow demonstrates the full data science lifecycle:

- Business Understanding
- Data Understanding
- Data Preparation
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Modeling & Evaluation
- Deployment Considerations


📂 Dataset

- Source: House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques – Kaggle
- Shape: 1,460 rows × 81 features (train)
- Target Variable: SalePrice (continuous numeric value in USD)

Key Feature Categories
- Property Characteristics: LotArea, LotShape, Neighborhood, OverallQual, YearBuilt
- Interior/Exterior Quality: GrLivArea, BsmtQual, KitchenQual, GarageFinish
- Amenities: Fireplaces, Pools, Garages, etc.

🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Data Quality Checks

✅ Missing values found in several categorical (PoolQC, Alley, Fence) and numerical features → imputed.
✅ Outliers in GrLivArea and SalePrice detected and processed.
✅ Mixed data types standardized.


Descriptive Statistics
| Variable    | Mean / Mode  | Min      | Max       | Comments                      |
| ----------- | ------------ | -------- | --------- | ----------------------------- |
| LotArea     | 10,517 sq ft | 1,300    | 215,245   | Heavily skewed                |
| OverallQual | 6.1          | 1        | 10        | Strong correlation with price |
| SalePrice   | \$180,921    | \$34,900 | \$755,000 | Right-skewed distribution     |


Visual Insights
- SalePrice vs OverallQual: Higher quality → higher price.
- SalePrice vs GrLivArea: Linear relationship, with a few outliers.
- Neighborhoods: Location is a strong driver of price variation.
- YearBuilt: Newer houses generally fetch higher prices.


🛠️ Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing values (median for numeric, mode or “None” for categorical).
- Log transformation applied to SalePrice to reduce skewness.
- One-hot encoding for categorical variables.
- Standardization of continuous variables.
- Outlier removal (extreme large living area houses).


🤖 Modeling & Evaluation
- Models Compared
- Linear Regression (baseline)
- Ridge & Lasso Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor
- Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost)


Metrics
- Evaluation: RMSE, MAE, R²
- Baseline (Linear Regression): RMSE ~ 45,000
- Best (XGBoost/LightGBM): RMSE ~ 13,000, R² ~ 0.92


📊 Results & Insights
- OverallQual, GrLivArea, Neighborhood, YearBuilt, GarageCars are the strongest predictors.
- Feature engineering (log transform of skewed variables + interaction terms) significantly improved performance.
- Ensemble models (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost) clearly outperform linear models.


🚀 Deployment Considerations
- Best-performing model exported as .pkl file for reuse.
- Flask/FastAPI service can expose prediction API.
- For production: monitor drift, retrain with updated housing market data.
